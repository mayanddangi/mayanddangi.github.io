			<h1>ECDL's Laser Locking System</h1>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			In the realm of atomic and molecualr physics, a frequency stable laser source is a crucial prerequisite for experiments involving quantum computers, quantum gravimeters, BEC, and other applications.
			In this project, we have developed a cost-effective laser frequency locking system using an STM-32 microcontroller with the objective of addressing the predicament of costly laser locking systems and providing a simple and economical solution to the scientific community. 
			Laser frequency locking plays a crucial role in various applications such as precision spectroscopy, optical communications, and many atomic physics experiments. It is a versatile and cost-effective control system needed for a stable laser frequency that minimizes the frequency drift to well below the optical transition linewidth of the Cs atom ~5.0 MHz. 
			We have used the Dichoric Atomic Vapor Laser Lock (DAVLL) system locking technique to lock our 852nm external cavity diode laser (ECDL). 
			Along with the automatic laser locking system, we have also developed a user-friendly interface using Python for peak selection from the spectroscopy signal.

		<h2>Hardware Architecture</h2>
		<p>
		The hardware architecture consists of two primary components: optics and electronics.
		The optics generate saturated absorption peaks corresponding to the hyperfine transition of Cesium atoms. This involves utilizing lasers and other optical elements to create specific spectroscopic conditions. 
		On the electronics side, the system reads the Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy (SAS) signal using a photodiode. To achieve the desired spectroscopic information, the frequency of the laser is modulated by adjusting the cavity length of an External Cavity Diode Laser (ECDL). 
		The electronics system further processes the SAS signal, generating an error signal to regulate the laser's cavity length and maintain optimal conditions by implementing a PID controller. This controller operates in conjunction with a Piezo driver, effectively displacing the grating to achieve the required laser frequency.
		</p>
		<!-- We intend to lock the laser at a desired frequency and this is mainly the transition frequency of hyperfine states of atoms. In our case, we are using Cesium atom and wish to lock laser at the cooling transition. -->
		<!-- And for the same, we need to generate a saturated absorbtion peaks corresponding to peak and an error signal to implement PID to adjust the cavity length of ECDL laser to change the frequency. We have used DAVLL spectroscopy to obtain the signals. -->

		<!-- <p> -->
		<!-- The opto-mechanical design of our External Cavity Diode Laser (ECDL) is carefully engineered to ensure versatility, stability, and precision in laser operation.  -->
		<!-- As illustrated in figure below, the ECDL comprises several key components, including a collimation mount for accommodating various wavelength laser diodes and collimation lenses without having any design modifications.  -->
		<!-- The laser casing is made up of aluminium with 10mm thicker wall to provide rigidity and vibrational stability.  -->
		<!-- </p> -->
		<!-- <p> -->
		<!-- The laser diode (Thorlabs L852H1) and collimation lens (Thorlabs C110TMD-B, aspheric lens with f = 6.24 mm and NA = 0.40) are carefully positioned on the collimation tube to maintain a shared optical axis and mechanical stability.  -->
		<!-- This design choice helps to reduce the influence of fluctuations in ambient temperature on their relative positions.  -->
		<!-- For driving the laser diode, a current and temperature controller from Thorlabs (ITC110) is used. Thorlabs GH13-18V is used as visible reflecting grating with 1800 lines/mm and 10% diffraction efficiency at 852 nm having polarization parallel to the grooves. It is glued over PZT chip on Thorlabs kinetic mirror mount. -->
		<!-- </p> -->
		<!-- <p> -->
		<!-- In the current design, the external cavity length is of 35mm. This system also has an active thermal control system which is implemented by incorporating a Peltier thermoelectric cooler (TEC) between the mount plate and bottom enclosure.  -->
		<!-- We secure the thermistor (Thorlabs TH10K) in place by using conducting glue to attach it to a small groove on the collimation mount.  -->
		<!-- By utilizing TEC and a temperature controller (ITC110), the system ensures the stability of the laser diode's temperature and prevents any alterations in the cavity length caused by fluctuations in ambient temperature. -->

		<h2>Software Architecture</h2>
		<h3>Lockpoint determination: Way 1</h3>
		<p>
		The described architecture follows a straightforward and user-driven approach. The lock point selection involves human observation of the spectroscopy signal within a Jupyter notebook. A microcontroller generates a ramp signal, while the photodiode signal is collected and transmitted to a remote computer through a serial port. Once the data is acquired, basic signal processing is applied to enhance signal clarity. The processed signal is then plotted to determine the lock point. This lock point information is transmitted back to the microcontroller over the serial port, initiating a PID loop to lock the laser at the specified point.Also, in PID loop whenever the accumulator crosses a threshold, it indicates a lock detoriation and then make the user aware to reinitiate the locking process.
		</p>
		<p>
		In addition, the PID loop incorporates a mechanism to identify any degradation in lock performance. One way to achieve this is by keeping an eye on the accumulator. When it surpasses a predetermined threshold, it acts as a signal that the lock is deteriorating. When this happens, the user is notified to restart the locking process to ensure a consistent and dependable laser lock. This system design incorporates a user-friendly approach that combines human observation, signal processing, and PID control. Its main objective is to ensure laser stability and promptly alert users of any potential issues that may arise.

		<h3>Lockpoint determination: Way 2</h3>
		<p>
		In the previous architecture, a human intervention is necessary whenever the lock detoriate or result in unlocked laser state. 
		While human intervention remains an option, autonomous operation necessitates the implementation of a self-sufficient lock point determination system. 
		This system would autonomously identify and establish the lock point, ensuring continuous and reliable operation without the need for human intervention.

		<h3>Lockpoint determination: Machine Learning</h3>
		<p>
		In the described architecture, the lock point is determined by locating a specific zero crossing point in the PD1-PD2 signal, achieved through the identification of local maxima and minima. 
		While this technique is generally effective, challenges arise in scenarios with noisy signals. 
		Even after filtration, the method may erroneously identify undesired maxima and minima that fall within a specified threshold value (difference between the maximum and minimum on the y-axis).
		</p>
		<p>
		To address these challenges, an alternative approach involves leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
		CNNs are known for their ability to effectively analyze complex patterns and features in data. 
		Implementing a CNN for lock point determination could enhance the system's robustness, potentially mitigating the impact of noise and improving accuracy. 
		This presents a promising avenue for automation within the system, offering a more sophisticated and adaptable solution to identify the lock point autonomously.
